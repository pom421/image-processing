## Image processing

Deno script (mainly generated by Claud AI) to change format of images and change their quality.

Ex: change all png files in an input folder and get some jpg files in an output folder, with a maximum width and a maximum size. 

Usage : 

```
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net normalize-images.ts
```
